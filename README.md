# matchit [![Say Thanks!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-!-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/chrisbra)
Vim matchit plugin (upstream repository)

The upstream maintained matchit plugin. The original has been created and
maintained by [Benji Fisher](https://github.com/benjifisher/matchit.zip),
however that looks now unmaintained.

Every once in a while, a snapshot from here will be sent to [Vim][1] upstream for 
distribution with Vim.

### Installation
The plugin is distributed as package and should be cloned below `pack/dist/opt`
in your runtime path (e.g. `~/.vim/pack/dist/opt/matchit`). Then it can be
activated in your .vimrc using the command:

    :packadd! matchit

### Documentation

- The latest matchit documentation is available here
  [doc/matchit.txt](https://github.com/chrisbra/matchit/blob/master/doc/matchit.txt)
- The matchit documentation distributed with Vim is available at
  [:h matchit](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/pack/dist/opt/matchit/doc/matchit.txt)
  (The help command only works after the plugin has been activated using the `:packadd` command)
